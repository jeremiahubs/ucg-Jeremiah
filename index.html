  <h1> Jeremiah </h1>
  <h2> School </h2>
  <p> Right now I am in the 11th grade and looking to be in the field of information technology. I find information technology cool because I use computers a lot and would like to know a little bit more about them. There are also people I have met that are doing information technology and they say they are having a good time.
    My favorite subjects are science and art.</p>
  <h2> Gaming </h2>
  <p> I play <a href="https://www.rocketleague.com" target="_blank">Rocket League</a>, some Geometry Dash, and some more random games. In Rocket League, I have a lot of time put into the game because I really like it. The concept of hitting a ball with a car sounds not real at first, but once you start getting into the game it turns into a really good game. Geometry Dash is a more simple game, but the possibilites in it are crazy. Some level examples of Geometry Dash are "<a href="https://youtu.be/xu1wRfUHtKg?si=EqBukfSRmVQXluvA" target="_blank"> WHAT </a>" and "<a href="https://youtu.be/RoazdzhDEIs?si=ElU0AosYLLj4SZXs" target="_blank"> Change Of Scene </a>". </p>
  <p> Other games I used to play are:</p>
  <ul>
    <li> NBA 2K16-18 </li>
    <li> FIFA 15-17 </li>
    <li> Fortnite </li>

  </ul>
  <h2> Food </h2>
  <p> Mostly any food type I like, except for if it has nuts in it. My favorite type of food is pasta. There are so many varieties of pasta that the right combination can be really delicious. Another food type I like is sandwiches. Its about the same reason for pasta, but there are even more possibilites.
